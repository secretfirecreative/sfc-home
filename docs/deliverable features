Deliverable Features

    Serverless Movie Listings Platform:
        
        Frontend: Use React with Next.js for SSR (Server-Side Rendering) to build a movie listing platform. Implement a responsive UI with modern JavaScript and React best practices.
        
        Backend API: Create serverless APIs using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. These APIs will serve movie data to the frontend. Use the AWS CDK to define the cloud infrastructure as code.
        
        Database: Use PostgreSQL with Prisma as the ORM to manage and query the database effectively.

    Digital Video Processing Workflow:
        
        Transcoding Service: Build a serverless function using AWS Lambda to handle video transcoding with FFmpeg. Use Step Functions to manage the workflow of uploading a video, transcoding it, and storing the output.
        
        Data Engineering: Implement feature extraction from the video files using AWS services and Python libraries like Scikit and Pandas. Extract metadata, generate thumbnails, and analyze video content.

    Search and Discovery Feature:
        
        Search API: Develop a search API to enable users to find movies based on various criteria. Leverage Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities.
       
        Machine Learning: Use AWS Lambda and machine learning services to provide recommendations and search enhancements based on user behavior and movie metadata.

    Automated Deployment Pipeline:
        
        CI/CD: Utilize GitHub Actions to set up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the testing and deployment process. Use Cypress and Jest for end-to-end and unit testing.
        
        Infrastructure Updates: Manage infrastructure changes using AWS CDK, allowing you to define cloud resources in a programmable way.

    Performance and Scaling:
        
        Content Delivery: Configure AWS CloudFront and CloudFront Functions to distribute content globally with low latency.
        
        Caching and Queuing: Implement caching strategies with Amazon RDS and use Amazon SQS for message queuing to handle high-load scenarios.

    Admin Dashboard for Content Management:
        
        Interface: Create an admin dashboard using React, allowing content creators to upload and manage their movie listings.
        
        Batch Processing: Integrate AWS Batch for running large-scale video processing jobs, managing the compute environment, and scheduling jobs.

    User Authentication and Authorization:
        
        Identity Management: Use Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization, enabling users to have secure access to the movie listings platform.

The focus of this project is to provide a practical demonstration of my ability to build a complex system, exhibiting the following qualities:

    -Mastery of full-stack development, from UI to API to database.
    -Use of serverless architecture to build scalable and cost-efficient applications.
    -Application of infrastructure as code for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
    -Implementation of continuous integration and delivery for automated testing and deployment.
    -Proficiency in modern JavaScript, cloud services, and software engineering best practices.

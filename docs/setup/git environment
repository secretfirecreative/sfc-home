Setting Up the Git Environment for sfc-home

    Create a New Repository:
        On GitHub, create a new repository under the Secret Fire Creative organization account. Name it in a way that reflects its purpose, for example, sfc-portfolio.
        Initialize it with a README, .gitignore (for Node.js if using NextJS), and a license if needed.

    Clone the Repository:
        Use Git Bash or your preferred terminal to clone the repository to your G:\GitRepos directory. This is a suitable location and there are no inherent issues with it being on a secondary drive.

    Branching Strategy:
        Adopt a branching strategy that suits your workflow. For a solo project, you might keep it simple:
            main branch for production-ready code.
            Feature branches for each new feature or significant change (e.g., feature/new-contact-form).
            Once a feature is complete and tested, it can be merged into main.

    Commit Practices:
        Commit small changes with descriptive messages.
        Push your commits to GitHub regularly to avoid losing work and to keep your remote repository updated.

    GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
        Set up GitHub Actions to automate your testing and deployment. For instance, when you push to the main branch, it could automatically deploy your site to Vercel.

Setting Up the Git Environment

    Create a New Repository:
        On GitHub, create a new repository under the Secret Fire Creative organization account. Name it in a way that reflects its purpose, for example, sfc-portfolio.
        Initialize it with a README, .gitignore (for Node.js if using NextJS), and a license if needed.

    Clone the Repository:
        Use Git Bash or your preferred terminal to clone the repository to your G:\GitRepos directory. This is a suitable location and there are no inherent issues with it being on a secondary drive.

    Branching Strategy:
        Adopt a branching strategy that suits your workflow. For a solo project, you might keep it simple:
            main branch for production-ready code.
            Feature branches for each new feature or significant change (e.g., feature/new-contact-form).
            Once a feature is complete and tested, it can be merged into main.

    Commit Practices:
        Commit small changes with descriptive messages.
        Push your commits to GitHub regularly to avoid losing work and to keep your remote repository updated.

    GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
        Set up GitHub Actions to automate your testing and deployment. For instance, when you push to the main branch, it could automatically deploy your site to Vercel.

Setting Up the Development Ecosystem

    Node.js and npm:
        Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. Since you'll be using NextJS, which runs on Node.js, it's crucial to have the LTS (Long Term Support) version installed.
        Along with Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager) will be installed. This will manage your JavaScript dependencies.

    Next.js:
        Once Node.js and npm are set up, you can globally install the Next.js CLI or use npx to create a new Next.js app in your Git repository directory.

    Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
        Use an IDE that supports JavaScript development. Visual Studio Code is a popular choice due to its extensive support for JavaScript and React/NextJS through extensions.

    React and Next.js:
        Within your project, you will use npm to install React and Next.js as dependencies.

    Other Technologies:
        As per the job description, you will also need PostgreSQL and an ORM like Prisma. PostgreSQL can be installed locally or run via a Docker container. Prisma would be added as a dependency in your project.

    AWS SDK:
        If your project requires AWS services, install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in your project.

    Testing Frameworks:
        Install Cypress and Jest for testing your application. These can be set up as dev dependencies in your project.

    Version Control and Collaboration:
        Keep using Git and GitHub for version control. Utilize GitHub's features such as Issues and Projects to manage and track your tasks.

    Docker (Optional):
        Docker can containerize your application, making it easy to manage dependencies and deploy your application consistently. This is optional but recommended if you plan to work with containers.

    Continuous Learning:
        Familiarize yourself with the documentation and best practices for each of these technologies. Use resources like official docs, tutorials, and community forums.

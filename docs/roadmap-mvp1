Step 1: Project Initialization

1.1. Initialize Next.js Application

    Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed).
    Create a new Next.js project using create-next-app.
    Run the application to ensure it's set up correctly.

1.2. Set Up Version Control

    Review the .gitignore file for any additions specific to Next.js.
    Make the initial commit with the Next.js boilerplate code.

1.3. Configure Linting and Formatting Tools

    Install ESLint and Prettier.
    Set up configuration files for both tools (.eslintrc.json and .prettierrc).
    Add pre-commit hooks using Husky to run linters/formatters on every commit.

1.4. Establish Coding Standards

    Document coding standards and conventions for JavaScript/React.
    Share the documentation with any potential collaborators.

Step 2: Development Environment Setup

2.1. IDE and Tools Installation

    Install and configure a preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
    Install IDE extensions for React/Next.js development.

2.2. Local Development Server Configuration

    Set up npm scripts for development tasks (npm run dev, npm start, npm build).
    Test hot-reloading and debugging to confirm the development environment is responsive.

2.3. Source Control Management

    Set up branch protection rules on GitHub for the main branch.
    Create a branching strategy for features, hotfixes, and releases.

2.4. Project File Structure

    Organize the file structure for components, pages, styles, and utilities.
    Create placeholder files/directories as needed.

Step 3: Core Frontend Development

3.1. Main Layout and Navigation

    Design the header and footer components.
    Implement responsive navigation (e.g., hamburger menu for mobile).

3.2. Landing Page Implementation

    Create the hero section with introductory content.
    Design and implement a portfolio section to highlight projects.

3.3. Projects Showcase Section

    Develop a dynamic component to display portfolio items.
    Integrate data fetching from a static source (to be replaced with API later).

3.4. Cross-Device Compatibility

    Test and ensure the website is responsive on various screen sizes.
    Conduct browser compatibility checks.

Step 4: Backend Integration

4.1. Database Selection and Setup

    Choose a database system suitable for the project's scale (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    Install the database locally or set up a managed database service.

4.2. Serverless Functions Development

    Identify necessary backend functions for the MVP.
    Set up a serverless environment with a provider (e.g., Vercel or AWS).

4.3. API Endpoints Creation

    Define RESTful routes for portfolio data retrieval.
    Create and test CRUD operations for the portfolio items.

4.4. Backend and Frontend Integration

    Fetch data in the frontend from the backend using API endpoints.
    Handle state management and data flow in the React application.

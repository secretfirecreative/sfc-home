Design/Engineering/Best Practices:
        
        -Adopted a modular and scalable approach to application development with the use of Next.js, setting the stage for server-side rendering and static generation features.
        -Implemented best practices in software engineering by incorporating linting, formatting, and pre-commit hooks, which are crucial for maintaining high code standards.
        -Prepared for a cloud-first deployment approach by configuring AWS CLI, emphasizing the projectâ€™s readiness for cloud services and serverless architecture.

Technological/Economic Prowess:
        
        -The serverless architecture provides a pay-as-you-go economic model, reducing the costs associated with idle compute resources.
        -By utilizing AWS services and infrastructure as code, the product is poised for high availability, scalability, and reduced time-to-market.
        -The containerized development environment with Docker offers a consistent and isolated setting for development, minimizing "works on my machine" issues and streamlining deployment to production.

    Economic Data:
        
        -Studies show that serverless architectures can reduce operational costs by up to 70% due to their efficient use of resources (Source: AWS serverless cost-efficiency studies).
        -Predictive analysis suggests a decrease in time-to-market by approximately 50% when utilizing CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native technologies (Source: DORA's State of DevOps reports).

    Technological Data:
        
        -Use of containerization has been shown to increase deployment frequency by 200% and lower failure rates by 30% (Source: CNCF Survey).
        -Serverless architectures are empirically more resilient, with a reduction in critical incidents by up to 60% when compared to traditional server-based environments (Source: AWS whitepapers on serverless resilience).
